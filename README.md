MT Engine MK1 NES / AGNES
=========================

**MT Engine MK1 NES / AGNES** (or **MK1_NES/AGNES** for short) is a framework composed by a modular engine coded in C and a set of tools to create simple games for the NES platform. 

This engine was built as an excercise to learn to write simple games for the NES. It compiles using a fairly old version of cc65 (2.13.2), and uses the original neslib by **Shiru**.

The library was used in early 2014 and during 2015 to create several games, some of them released. You can find those games (cleaned up and ready to be compiled) in the `examples` folder.

The library was discontinued in early 2015 and was superseeded by the new **MT Engine MK2** which is currently non stable and in continuous development. It's not hard to get hold if you follow our releases ;-)

I've decided to clean **MT Engine MK1 NES** up and make it useable - I've ended rewriting most of it, as always. I *might even write a tutorial*. This engine is easy and ready to use, and might be useful for somebody.

**Notice: current code in /src may not work as it is being revised for a final v1.0. Use releases->tags for old working code. Watch for this notice to be removed**

Update 20180514: **v0.99.5 released, almost there, but there's still some stuff missing (mostly docs)**

Credits
=======

**MT Engine MK1 NES** was designed and developed by **The Mojon Twins** and relies on:

* **neslib** and **famitone**, written by Shiru.
* Some tools written by the **Mojon Twins**.
* The old **cc65 v2.13.2**

**But** if you make a game with the engine we understand you'll want to make it into a cart. **In such case, just tell us!** Write to mojontwins@gmail.com **We will, most likely, say yes**. 

The **games** included in the `examples` folder are now free to produce, which means **you can put them into carts and sell them, as long as you tell us first and send us a couple of copies**. You will eventually find assets (stickers and possibly cover art) alongside the game ROM in each game folder.
