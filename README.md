Churrera NES
============

Churrera NES is a framework composed by a modular engine coded in C and a set of tools to create simple games for the NES platform. Churrera NES needs the CC65 compiler and uses Shiru's excelent Neslib. Churrera NES is a rewrite of Churrera, a simmilar package for the ZX Spectrum.
