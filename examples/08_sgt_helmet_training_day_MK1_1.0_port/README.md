What's this?
============

I've made LOTS of changes to MK1 in order to make it ready for release and to polish stuff and remove shit I didn't like, or enhance some modules and dah dah dah.

The thing is that I'm sure I have broken everything.

Porting old games to the new version will help me debug the engine.
