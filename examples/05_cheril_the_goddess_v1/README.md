Cheril the Goddess (v1)
=======================

The big Cheril project also included a revamped version of Cheril the Goddess. The gameplay differs somewhat from the ZX Original, but the phylosophy of finding the sacred stones of Rock - Paper - Scissors and use them to beat the temples to gain access to the end remains intact.

This game heavily modifies MK1 in many places. Our engines are meant to be modified to fit your needs. Every game has been made extending the existing code base. Some modifications just remain. Some don't.

This game was shelved alongside the whole project. It was 100% remade from scractch for the Nesdev Compo in 2016, making it a side scroller with much better graphics and an awesome soundtrack.

This is the original, MK1 v0.5 version.
