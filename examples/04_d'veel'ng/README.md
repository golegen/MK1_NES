This game was part of the planned, never finished, never released "Cheril" game containing ports of every Cheril game released for the ZX Spectrum as separate levels.

It is just a mirrored version of "Cheril of the Bosque" with a different tileset and different gameplay (featuring shooting).

Some assets and ideas from this game have been (re)used in "MiedoW - Cheri's Nightmares", released for the Nesdev Compo 2017.

Enhancements to MK1 resulted on MK1 v0.4.
Improvements include a more efficient storage for enemy placements and tilemaps.
