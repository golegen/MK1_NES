Cheril of the Bosque (v1)
=========================

*This is v1. The game "Cheril of the Bosque" included in multicarts such as '31-in-1', etc is a remade version using the new MK2 engine*

In early 2015 we planned to make the single-level Cheril Perils a full fledged game containing ports of all the Cheril games released for the ZX Spectrum, with a hud level to access them and lots of flashy stuff.

MK1 NES got heavily revamped and enhanced. The toolchain was vastly improved. The first incarnations of mkts.exe (our almighty graphics converter) were created.

This early version of Cheril of the Bosque (never released) was intented to be a hidden game first, then a bonus stage (with the map split in several subsections). Then, the project got shelved.

In 2016, the assets of this game (map, graphics, music) were used to test the top-down routines in the new MK2 engine. The finished game got into '31-in-1' and other multicarts.

This is the original, MK1 v0.2 version from early 2015.
