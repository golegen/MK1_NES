# Examples

In this folder you can find a collection of games created with **MK1 NES / AGNES**. The first six games were created with legacy versions of MK1, the last six were created using the latest version available and have been updated as development progressed. That means that examples 7-12 have exactly the same engine code as found in `/src/dev`.

## Sgt. Helmet Training Day

This was the first game coded with MK1 NES, back in December, 2013. Engine version v0.1. 

There's an updated version of the game (using the latest version of **MK1 NES / AGNES**) in the testers folder ([here](https://github.com/mojontwins/MK1_NES/tree/master/testers/01_tester_top_down)).

## Jet Paco

The second game coded with MK1 NES, shortly after Sgt. Helmet. Also engine version v0.1.

## Cheril of the Bosque

We ported this game from the ZX Spectrum as a part of a big project featuring all Cheril's adventures in a single game which never materialized (so this game has been remained unpublished). There's a *Cheril of the Bosque* game in ([Mojon Twins - Gran Sabiduría 31 in 1](https://github.com/mojontwins/Gran_Sabiduria_v2)), which is a remake using MK2, a different engine.

Engine version 0.2.

## D'Veel'Ng

Also part of the big Cheril game, unfinished and unreleased, has been salvaged and completed for the release of AGNES. Engine version 0.4

## Cheril the Goddess

Also part of the big Cheril game, also unfinished and unreleased, also salvaged and complete for the release of AGNES. Engine version 0.5.

This game was remade from the ground up as [Cheril the Goddess R](https://github.com/mojontwins/GoddessR) and featured as an entrant of the nesdev compo, 2016 edition.

## Lala Prologue

Last game featuring MK1 NES. Not a complete game, it was then transformed into Lala the Magical, which engine evolved from MK1 v0.7 into something quite different. After completing Lala, we ditched MK1 NES completely and coded a new, simmilar engine from scratch, MK2, which is featured in most games of [Mojon Twins - Gran Sabiduría 31 in 1](https://github.com/mojontwins/Gran_Sabiduria_v2) and our entry for the nesdev compo in 2017, [MiedoW](https://github.com/mojontwins/Miedow_NES).

Years later, we decided to clean up MK1 NES for release (and finish and release some unreleased oldies), but ended up rewriting most of it. MK1 NES then became AGNES.

## Cheril Perils Classic

A rehash of ditched ideas and salvaged assets implementing a nice revision of our classic Cheril Perils. Using AGNES v1.0

## Cheril the Writer

Created as a showcase of the capabilites of the engine. A 'Mega Cheril Perils' sequel of sorts. Using AGNES v1.0

## Cadàveriön

A port from the ZX Spectrum original which was going to be part of the abandoned big Cheril Game we talked about before but was never made. Using AGNES v1.0

## Che Man

A present for a good friend. Using AGNES v1.0.

## Bootèe

Most of level 1 was part of the abandoned big Cheril Game. We turned it into a standalone title. Using AGNES v1.0

## Espitene

Initially a tester created to test the 'tile get' feature and a case of "this escalated quickly". The final product is a mammoth with 18 levels and 6 bosses which uses almost every feature in AGNES and every way to customize and enhance the engine without touching the core.

Examples 7-12 come with a *post mortem* explaining how the game was designed and built around AGNES.
