Jet Paco
========

This game was coded in late 2013. It made, alongside Sgt. Helmet's Training Day the initial version of MT Engine MK1 for NES, a revised port of the engine of the same name we had for the ZX Spectrum computer.

The code is very crude and there are lots of things that are done in a very awkward way. We dodn't know cc65 or the hardware very well and it shows.

The toolchain was also in its infancy, with lots of manual work required (specially to convert graphics).

MK1 v0.1 is used in three games:
- Sgt. Helmet's Training Day
- Jet Paco
- Cheril Perils (never finished / released in this form)
