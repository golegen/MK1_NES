Lala Prologue
=============

We started this game with the idea of including Lala Lah and several other stages, but ditched it when we thought that using two nametables and get scrolling "for free" was a better idea. We started a new game from scratch, added magic and cutscenes, and **Lala the Magical** was born.

I've rescued this original version. I had to testore the assets, I only conserved a zipped dev folder.

Yun's engine evolved from an older version of MK1 (maybe 0.6?). Consider it a fork. That's why Yun isn't here.

This game contains what seems to be the latest version of MK1.
