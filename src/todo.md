===================================

Integrate enhancements introduced with Yun. Yun evolved from an older MK1 version, it was "forked" around 0.4, so many later stuff isn't included. But it contains sensible enhancements in terms both of size and speend which should be included!

	[X] CLEANSE, for god's sake!
